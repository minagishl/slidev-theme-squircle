# Why Open Source Matters

## Community Driven

Building together creates stronger, more resilient software that everyone can rely on.

## Transparency

Open code means open review — bugs get caught faster and trust is built over time.

## Innovation

Ideas from around the world merge into solutions no single team could have created alone.

---
layout: profile
---

::name::

# Profile Layout

::default::

<Label>Layouts — Profile</Label>

Use `::name::` for the heading area and the default slot for body content.\
Optional `heading` adds an accent-bar label in the corner.

Works well for speaker bios, product intros, or feature summaries.

---
layout: profile
---

# Profile with List

::default::

<Label>Layouts — Profile</Label>

1. Name slot\
   Primary title or identity for the slide

2. Default slot\
   Supporting details, lists, or short paragraphs

# Label Component

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

<Label>Top Left (default)</Label>
<Label position="top-right">Top Right</Label>
<Label position="bottom-left">Bottom Left</Label>
<Label position="bottom-right">Bottom Right</Label>

Use `<Label>` to place a label in any corner of the slide.

The `position` prop accepts `top-left` (default), `top-right`, `bottom-left`, or `bottom-right`.

---
layout: frame-panel
color: blue
---

<Label position="top-right">Top Right Label</Label>

Label component works on any layout — not just panel or profile.

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

<Note>Bottom Left (default)</Note>
<Note position="bottom-right">Bottom Right</Note>
<Note position="top-left">Top Left</Note>
<Note position="top-right">Top Right</Note>

Use `<Note>` for small, muted annotation text in any corner.

The `position` prop works the same as `<Label>`. Default is `bottom-left`.

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

<PageNumber />

Use `<PageNumber />` to show the current page number. Built on top of `<Label>`.

Add `showTotal` to also display the total number of slides.

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

<PageNumber :showTotal="true" position="bottom-right" />

With `:showTotal="true"`, the format becomes `current / total`.

The `position` prop works the same as `<Label>`. Default is `bottom-right`.

---
layout: section
---

# Q&A Component

---
layout: panel
align: left
---

<Label>Q&A Example</Label>

<QA question="What is the QA component?">
  A component for showing question-and-answer pairs on a slide. Use the <code>question</code> prop for the question and the default slot for the answer.
</QA>

<QA question="Can I place multiple QA items on one slide?">
  Yes — stack multiple <code>&lt;QA&gt;</code> components. A gap is automatically added between them.
</QA>

---
layout: frame-panel
color: blue
---

<Label>Single Q&A</Label>

<QA question="Where can I use this component?">
  In any layout — panel, frame-panel, cols, or any other frame-based layout.
</QA>

# Code Blocks

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

## Code Blocks & Inline Code

Fenced code blocks use the standard dark background.

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet('World'))
```

Inline `code` uses a gray background by default.
Use `<Underline>text</Underline>` to apply a blue underline: <Underline>underlined code</Underline>

---
layout: section
---

# Blockquotes

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

## Blockquote styling

Use standard Markdown blockquotes to call out important statements.

> Great design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
>
> — Steve Jobs

You can also mix blockquotes with other text on the same slide.

---
layout: section
---

# Badges

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

## Badge component

Use `<Badge>` for short inline labels such as release status, experimental features, or emphasis next to body text.

<Badge>New</Badge> <Badge variant="soft">Beta</Badge> <Badge variant="outline">Draft</Badge>

This release is <Badge>stable</Badge> — mix badges freely with paragraphs and headings.

---
layout: section
---

# Highlight

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

## Highlight component

Use `<Highlight>` for key phrases — a marker stroke through the lower half of the text.

<Highlight>Blue variant</Highlight> (default) and <Highlight variant="amber">amber</Highlight> for classic highlighter accents.

Call <Highlight>`useState`</Highlight> when the phrase includes inline `code`.

---
layout: section
---

# Dividers

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

## Divider component

Use `<Divider>` to separate sections within a slide. Default is a primary-colored solid line.

<Divider />

Muted variant for lighter separation:

<Divider variant="muted" />

Dashed variant:

<Divider variant="dashed" spacing="lg" />

---
layout: section
---

# Note Blocks

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

## NoteBlock component

Use the `NoteBlock` component to create emphasized note blocks without writing raw HTML divs.

<NoteBlock type="info">
Information
This is an informational note. The second line is optional.
</NoteBlock>

<NoteBlock type="warn">
Warning
Please pay attention to this point.
</NoteBlock>

<NoteBlock type="alert">
Alert
Do not perform this action.
</NoteBlock>

---
layout: section
---

# Fact rows

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

## FactRow component

Use `<FactRow>` for release metadata, API fields, or any label–value pairs. Stack several rows; spacing and dividers are handled by the theme.

<FactRow label="Theme">Slidev Theme Squircle</FactRow>
<FactRow label="Version">0.0.0</FactRow>
<FactRow label="Package">

`slidev-theme-squircle` on npm

</FactRow>

<FactRow label="Ellipsis font">themeConfig.ellipsisFont: cjk | latin</FactRow>

---
layout: section
---

# Icons

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

## Icon component

Use `<Icon>` to render Lucide icons inline. Icons load from the Lucide static CDN (`name` matches the icon file without `.svg`, e.g. `mail`, `github`, `external-link`). Optional `size` prop: `sm`, `md` (default), or `lg`.

Contact us at <Icon name="mail" /> email@example.com or visit <Icon name="github" /> GitHub.

<Icon name="info" size="lg" /> Large info icon · <Icon name="alert-triangle" size="sm" /> Small warning

---
layout: section
---

# Keyboard Keys

---
layout: panel
color: black
align: left
---

## Kbd component

Use `<Kbd>` to display keyboard keys inline. Combine multiple keys to show shortcuts. Pass an `icon` prop to render a lucide icon (`command`, `arrow-up`, `arrow-down`, `arrow-left`, `arrow-right`).

Open the command palette with <Kbd icon="command" /> + <Kbd>K</Kbd>.

Save the current file using <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>S</Kbd>.

Navigate slides with <Kbd icon="arrow-left" /> and <Kbd icon="arrow-right" />, or move down with <Kbd icon="arrow-down" />.

The default cursor is a pointer and hovering plays a subtle press animation. Pass `no-hover` for decorative keys that should stay still: <Kbd no-hover>Esc</Kbd>.

Each key sits centered on the text line, so multiple lines of shortcuts stack cleanly without overlapping.
